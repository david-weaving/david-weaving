# Hi, I'm David Weaver ðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergraduate student at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. From a young age, I've been intrigued by how computers communicate and interact. I started learning how to code when I was 13 when I attempted to create a game in ROBLOX using LUA. My passion lies in coding, math, and physics. I love problem solving and enjoy taking on tough challenges. I'm fascinated by AI/ML and the mathematical foundations of computing.
