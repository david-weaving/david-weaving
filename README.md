# Hi, I'm David Weaver ðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergraduate student at Cal Poly SLO pursuing a degree in Computer Science. From a young age, I've been intrigued by how computers communicate and interact. I began learning to code at 13, starting with LUA. Since then, I have learned C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My passion lies in coding, math, and physics. I love problem solving and enjoy taking on tough challenges. I'm fascinated by AI/ML and the mathematical foundations of computing.
